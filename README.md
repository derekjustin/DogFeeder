# DogFeeder
Dog feeder based on Operant Conditioning.

Summary
This code will use the concepts of operant conditioning to feed a dog on a varied reinforcement schedule.  The concepts of operant conditioning used in this code are variable schedule of reinforcement, positive reinforcement, secondary reinforcement, and randomized jackpotting.  

Varied and randomized reinforcement schedules

In the preliminary phases the feeder will have two scheduled feeding times dictated by the operator.  The first feeding will produce a scaled randomized reinforcement dependent on the caloric intake of the animalâ€™s weight, age, and calories per cup of food (Brand of dog food). The second feeding will take the difference of the first feeding.  The second feeding will then calculate how much is remaining and feed the remainder. 

Secondary Reinforcement (Bridge)

In concurrence with the introduction of primary reinforcement the animal will also be conditioned on a secondary reinforcement.  The secondary reinforcement in this scenario is a short audio output.  After multiple trials the secondary reinforcement will be established with the operant(dog).
